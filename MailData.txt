patch2;everyone;New Update (0.9);Hey there- we've added a new update, bringing new paths to Candy Island and adding some quality of life features. If you haven't yet, download the new update on our website at https://sites.google.com/view/msm-tll/download to play! As well, due to some tweaking of the game, a few people's T-Roxes on Noramba Desert became voidcorns. Please help yourselves to a free T-Rox as compensation (youll need to open this mail message on Desert to claim it!) Happy Monstering!;icon@newspaper;diamonds@25;Monsters/Monster_trox@1
